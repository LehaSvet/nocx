// What an agent's MCP session is TOLD when it initializes (nocx-xn63t.6.45).
//
// # The defect this answers
//
// A coordinator's Claude session initialized nocx's stdio MCP server and got
// back protocolVersion, capabilities and serverInfo — and nothing to say who
// was talking to it. Asked to spawn a worker, the model reached for the global
// herdr skill it already had and started a pane outside nocx, while the tools
// it had been granted sat unused one namespace away. The grant was never the
// problem; the sentence that points at it was missing.
//
// # Why the ENDPOINT says this, and not the MCP adapter
//
// internal/mcpstdio owns protocol translation and transport lifecycle, and it
// is held to that by its own boundary test: the domain's vocabulary ("worker",
// the workers.* names) may not appear in its source at all, so that the adapter
// stays a translator rather than becoming a second place that knows what a
// worker is. The words belong where the GRANT is, and that is here — the same
// rule contracts/toolendpoint.md states for tools.catalogue: "No caller may
// derive its own eligibility." A caller that had to work out its own role from
// its tools would be deriving it.
//
// # Why two texts, and how the role is decided
//
// The role is read off the admitted grant rather than guessed or passed in: a
// coordinator's grant permits Delegate — handing work to another agent is what
// the effect names, and spawning is that act — and a worker's grant permits
// Observe alone (internal/app/worker_auth.go's participantGrant says so in one
// place). So the question "may this caller start a worker" is answerable from
// authority the endpoint already holds, and it is answerable BEFORE the caller
// has listed a single tool.
//
// A CALLER THAT IS NEITHER — a grant that may delegate nothing and reports
// nothing — is told the neutral sentence. It is not an error and not silence:
// an MCP client that receives no instructions at all is the state this finding
// was filed against.
//
// # What the text owes the reader
//
// Three things, and each is a defect when missing:
//
//   - WHERE IT IS. That the session runs inside nocx, because the model's other
//     habits (a global skill, a terminal multiplexer the shell provides) are
//     exactly what it reaches for otherwise.
//   - WHICH CALLS DO THE WORK, named as the wire names them. A tool name in
//     this text that the registry does not declare, or that this caller's grant
//     does not offer, sends an agent to a call that does not exist and the
//     failure is silent — it simply never spawns. instructions_test.go looks
//     every name up in the assembled registry and in the caller's own
//     catalogue, with a negative half proving the scan bites.
//   - HOW TO REACH A DEFERRED TOOL. Some clients (Claude Code) do not put MCP
//     tools in the model's list at all; they are loaded by a search first, and
//     a model told to use a tool it cannot see reports that it has none. The
//     selector is spelled in the client's own syntax and its server name is
//     pinned to the key the staged MCP config writes.
