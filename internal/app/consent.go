// The consent resolver: what the helper selection may do for one machine at
// one consultation (ADR-0034: the answer is keyed by the destination's
// host-key fingerprint, in internal/helper/consent; ADR-0068: the helper is
// decided by the connection, never by a feature).
//
// Two callers consult it, and only one may act on ConsentRequired.
// openHoldingLease, at connect, is where ADR-0068 puts the ask — beside the
// host-key verification, once per machine — so it is the only caller
// allowed to turn ConsentRequired into an actual prompt. helperGitFactory,
// at git.open, treats ConsentRequired exactly like Refused: a feature
// surface consumes whatever the connection already decided and may never
// raise the tier itself.
//
// This superseded D8, which put the ask at the git panel instead and needed
// a second condition — "a surface on this connection has asked for the
// helper" — to keep a shipped binary from opting every machine in silently
// (the 2026-08-10 footprint-consent design's auto ladder resolved helper
// from "a suitable binary exists for that platform" alone, which becomes
// true everywhere the day one ships). ADR-0068 answers that worry a
// different way: the connect-time ask runs once per machine, automatically,
// so the second condition — and the option that carried it — is gone with
// it.
//
// AND A CONNECTION THAT NAMES THE HELPER IS ASKED TOO (ADR-0104, nocx-1kejz.3).
// Until then this ladder answered an explicit `helper` with DesiredHelper and
// never consulted the store — "an explicit helper choice is the consent for
// the binary", §4.3 — which read the connection's METHOD as the machine's
// PERMISSION. A connection whose profile said `helper` therefore deployed a
// binary the machine had never been asked about, and the editor's own consent
// field (a leftover ADR-0034 deleted the owner of) was the only place that
// question appeared to be answered. The method and the permission are two
// questions with two owners — the connection for the first, the machine for
// the second — so `helper` now waits for the same answer `auto` waits for.
