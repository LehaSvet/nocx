// AN UNSAVED HOST ASKS FOR ITS PASSWORD (nocx-1ebrs.44).
//
// The connect UI's direct entry — a host typed or pasted, with no saved
// connection behind it — opens through the same helper path a profile does,
// carrying one difference: no ConnectionName and no ProfileID, because there
// is nothing saved for a prompt to name or a remember to bind to. What the
// path used to do with a password-only host was end at the server's refusal:
// the keys the machine discovered were offered alone, the server answered
// "no supported methods remain", and the pane showed the raw chain — while
// typing `ssh` to the same host prompted and connected.
//
// These tests drive the shipped seam — this machine's helper over a real
// reverse channel, the real ssh service and spawner behind it, the scripted
// far side and the scripted coordinator answers, assembled as the Files
// acceptance builds them. What is asserted is the interval the bead names:
// a prompt is raised (naming no connection, because there is none), the
// answer authenticates, the pane opens — and when the answer is wrong, the
// sentence a person reads is one they can act on.
