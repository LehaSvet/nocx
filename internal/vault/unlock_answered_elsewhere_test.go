package vault

// AN ASK IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE VAULT'S STATE, NOT A DIALOG WITH A LIFE OF
// ITS OWN (nocx-1ebrs.7).
//
// Measured in the e2e stand on the branch that made the prompt visible: a
// restored ssh pane asked the helper's coordinator for a stored password
// while the replacement backend's vault was still sealed and no client was
// attached, so the ask suspended. The spec then unsealed the vault by its
// RPC 104 ms later. At 1.75 s the fresh page attached, the suspended ask was
// re-raised and presented — a passphrase demanded after it had been given,
// holding focus, with nothing behind it to answer.
//
// Two halves are pinned here. The raise loop re-reads the vault's state after
// every wait and answers its waiters with nil when the vault is already open;
// and Unseal retires an ask that is already on its way to a person. The pair
// below is the whole point: an ask suspended against a sealed vault that is
// unsealed by another path must not be raised at the attach, and one still
// sealed at the attach must be, exactly once — otherwise "never raise" would
// pass the first test.
