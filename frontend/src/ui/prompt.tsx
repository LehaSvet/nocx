   * over something must be a DOM child of it, which is also how the connection
   * editor's own password prompt has always appeared above its dialog.
   *
   * A `Portal`, not `host.appendChild(element)`. Moving the node by hand put
   * it where Solid does not expect it: closing the prompt by unmounting its
   * owner — which is what `<Show when={unlockOpen()}>` does — removed nothing,
   * because Solid removes from the parent it inserted into. The overlay entry
   * popped and the panel stayed on screen with the caret still in it, so the

   * the dialog under it, the panel having been a child of that dialog all
   * along. Measured in a browser; the entry was gone from the stack while the
   * element was still in the DOM.
   *
   * IT IS THE ENTRY BELOW US, NOT THE TOP ONE, and it is re-read whenever the
   * stack changes. A host is not permanent: the connection overlay is a modal
   * `<dialog>` that closes ITSELF when the socket comes up, and a prompt raised
   * while it was up is a DOM child of it — so `dialog:not([open])`'s
   * `display: none` took the prompt off the screen with the connection screen,
   * still open and still on the overlay stack. That is the vault unlock
   * question vanishing in front of the person it was asked of, on the first
   * connection after an upgrade (nocx-1ebrs.7). Reading the stack reactively
