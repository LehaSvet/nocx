/**
 * e2e: A SAVED PROFILE WHOSE KEY IS IN THE VAULT OPENS A PANE OVER THE HELPER
 * (nocx-1ebrs.17), and it does so with an RSA key against a host that refuses
 * SHA-1 signatures.
 *
 * # What a person can do that they could not before
 *
 * A saved ssh connection whose private key is stored in nocx's vault opens a
 * pane — the path every existing user with a remote host takes, and the one
 * 0.6 broke while 0.4 connected.
 *
 * # The gap this closes, which is why it is a spec rather than a unit test
 *
 * The one helper-path ssh spec (ssh-helper-happy-path.spec.ts) seeds a stored
 * PASSWORD. No e2e exercised a pane whose credential is a KEY IN THE VAULT, and
 * that is precisely the configuration that shipped broken: the key was right,
 * the vault was unlocked, the helper offered it, the coordinator signed it —
 * with `ssh-rsa`, SHA-1, because the helper's reverse signer could not be asked
 * for a negotiated algorithm. The server's own journal said
 *
 *     userauth_pubkey: signature algorithm ssh-rsa not in PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms
 *
 * # Two keys, one host, and why both
 *
 * `cmd/e2e-sshd` accepts a modern sshd's algorithm list (ssh-rsa EXCLUDED, as
 * OpenSSH 8.8 and later default to) and, with `-rsa-key`, mints an RSA key
 * beside its ed25519 one. BOTH are stored in the vault and BOTH open a pane:
 * the ed25519 case is what passed all along — its type IS its algorithm — so it
 * proves the transport while the RSA case isolates the algorithm. A report from
 * one machine saying "it works here" was exactly this half.
 *
 * # No timing
 *
 * Every wait is on an observable state: a session that did not exist before the
 * profile was asked for, bound to the pane the renderer built, and the far
 * host's own `AUTH=` counter for a connection that really authenticated.
